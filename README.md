# Oniro IDE

Oniro IDE is a lightweight, integrated development environment as a Visual Studio Code Extension tailored for Oniro/OpenHarmony application development. It provides a streamlined workflow for building, signing, deploying, running, and debugging Oniro apps, as well as managing SDKs and emulators.

## Features

- **Oniro Tree View**: Access all Oniro development actions from a dedicated sidebar, including build, sign, emulator control, app install/launch, SDK Manager, and HiLog Viewer.
- **Project Creation**: Create a new Oniro/OpenHarmony (ArkTS/ArkUI) project from a template, with initial SDK/module configuration and workspace settings.
- **Build and Sign**: Compile and sign your Oniro/OpenHarmony application with a single command.
- **Emulator Management**: Start, stop, and connect to the Oniro emulator directly from VS Code.
- **App Deployment**: Install and launch `.hap` packages on the emulator or connected device.
- **Run All**: One-click workflow to start the emulator, build, install, and launch your app, then open the HiLog Viewer for live logs.
- **HiLog Viewer**: View and filter real-time logs from your running Oniro app within VS Code.
- **SDK Manager**: Install, update, or remove OpenHarmony SDKs, command-line tools, and the Oniro emulator via a graphical interface.
- **Oniro Tasks**: Run Oniro-specific build tasks from the VS Code task system.
- **Debugging**: Debug Oniro applications using the "Oniro Debug" configuration.

## Requirements

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- Java SDK (for building/signing apps)
- QEMU (for running the Oniro emulator)

Ensure all dependencies are installed and available in your `PATH`.

## Installation

### From Marketplace / Open VSX

Install Oniro IDE from either:
- Visual Studio Code Marketplace: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=francescopham.oniro-ide
- Open VSX Registry (for VSCodium / compatible IDEs): https://open-vsx.org/extension/francescopham/oniro-ide

Steps (VS Code or compatible):
1. Open the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
2. Search for Oniro IDE.
3. Click Install.

### From Source (Development)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/eclipse-oniro4openharmony/oniro-vscode-ext.git
cd oniro-ide

# Install dependencies and build
npm install
npm run compile

# Open in VS Code and launch extension host
code .
# Press F5 to start the Extension Development Host
```

## Usage

1. Install and enable the Oniro IDE extension in VS Code.
2. Use the Oniro sidebar to access all main actions, or open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and search for Oniro commands.
3. Create a new project:
    - Run **Oniro: Create Project** (`oniro-ide.createProject`).
    - Choose a template, project name, bundle name, location, SDK API, and module name.
    - Click **Create** and then **Open Project**.
    - The extension creates `local.properties` (with `sdk.dir=...`) so the build uses the installed SDK base directory.
4. Typical workflow:
   - **SDK & Tools Setup**: Open the **SDK Manager** from the sidebar to install or update the required OpenHarmony SDKs, command-line tools, and the Oniro emulator before starting development.
   - **Signature Configs**: If your application does not already have signing configurations, generate them using the Oniro IDE (see sidebar or command palette for signature config generation commands).
   - **Build and Sign**: Use **Oniro: Build App** and **Oniro: Sign App** to prepare your application.
   - **Emulator**: Start the emulator with **Oniro: Start Emulator** and connect if needed (**Oniro: Connect Emulator**).
   - **Deploy**: Install your `.hap` package using **Oniro: Install App** and launch it with **Oniro: Launch App**.
   - **Run All**: Use **Oniro: Run All (Emulator, Build, Install, Launch)** for a full automated flow, including log streaming.
   - **HiLog Viewer**: View logs for your running app with **Oniro: Show HiLog Viewer**.

- `oniro-ide.build`: Build the Oniro app
- `oniro-ide.sign`: Sign the Oniro app
- `oniro-ide.startEmulator`: Start the Oniro emulator
- `oniro-ide.stopEmulator`: Stop the Oniro emulator
- `oniro-ide.connectEmulator`: Connect to the running emulator

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings (see VS Code settings for details):

- `oniro.sdkRootDir`: Root directory where OpenHarmony SDKs are installed. Default: `${userHome}/setup-ohos-sdk`
- `oniro.cmdToolsPath`: Directory where OpenHarmony command-line tools are installed. Default: `${userHome}/command-line-tools`
- `oniro.emulatorDir`: Directory where Oniro emulator is installed. Default: `${userHome}/oniro-emulator`

## Known Issues

Please report issues and feature requests via the GitHub repository.

## Suggested `launch.json` Configuration

To allow the integrated F5 launch shortcut to automatically execute the Oniro "Run All" workflow, add the following configuration to your `.vscode/launch.json` file:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Oniro: Launch App (with Run All)",
            "type": "oniro-debug",
            "request": "launch"
        }
    ]
}
```

This will let you use F5 or the "Run" button in VS Code to trigger the Oniro "Run All" command for building, deploying, and launching your app.

## ArkTS Language Integration

For additional integration for the ArkTS language, use the [ArkTS VS Code plugin](https://github.com/Groupguanfang/arkTS), which supports source code navigation and completion. It also supports codelinter to detect errors.
